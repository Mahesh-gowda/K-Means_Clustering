# K-Means_Clustering
K-means method is used and to determine the K value Elbow method is used!

The dataset is about and what our mission is.

There is a big mall in a specific city that contains information of its clients the clients that subscribe

to the membership card when the client subscribe to the card they provided their information like their

gender their age and their annual income.

And because they have this card they use it to buy all sorts of things in the mall.

And therefore the mall has to purchase history of each of its client member.

And that's how they obtained the last column here which is a spending score.

So as a reminder of the spending score is a score that the amount computed for each of their clients

based on several criteria including for example their income the number of times per week they show

up in the mall.

And of course the amount of dollars they spent in a year and based on all this they computed this metric

that takes values between 1 and 100.

So that the closer to spending score is 1 and the less declined spends and the closer the spending

scores to 100 the more decline spends.

And eventually after collecting this data set the goal of the project is to segment their clients in two different groups based on these two metrics.
The annual income and the spending score and since the mall has no idea of what this client segments

might be or even has no idea about how many segments there would be.

This is typically a clustering problem because we don't know the answers.
